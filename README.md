# Optimizing-Crop-Production-
In this project, Dataset contains the condition for growing different crops. We analyze these conditions and form clusters of crops which helps to understand which group of crops require similar kinds of condition to grow. We used K means clustering. We analyzed the different climatic conditions required for different crops, we performed multiclass classification and predicted which crop can be grown with given climatic conditions.
